# Kaiko Pipeline

## Introduction

Put simply, this tool takes raw proteomic input and outputs a FASTA file of those organisms most likely to be present in the proteomic input.

The pipeline uses neural networks to identify peptide sequences from raw proteomic input, which are then aligned against all protein sequences using a diamond search. This offers us a view of those organisms most likely to be present in the proteomic samples, with which we make a FASTA file from the most likely organisms identified.


## Setup

Uses python 3.10 and tensorflow 2.11.0. The full list of requirements can be found in ```Kaiko_volume/setup_libraries.txt```

Before first use, a few files are needed.

### Downloading Files

1) Run the file `Kaiko_denovo/model/get_data.sh` to download the trained Kaiko denovo model.

Download the following files to the ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_stationary_files``` folder.

1) [UniRef100 FASTA](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/uniref/uniref100/uniref100.fasta.gz) Large file, 80 Gb+.

2) [UniRef100 XML](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/uniref/uniref100/uniref100.xml.gz) Large file, 100 Gb+.

3) [NCBI Taxonomy dump](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/new_taxdump/new_taxdump.zip) Less than 1Gb.

4) [Diamond search](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/releases), choosing the appropriate system. If using Docker, get the Linux version.

### Processing

1) Extract the diamond file from step 4 into its own folder within ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_stationary_files```, eg ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_stationary_files/diamond```. 

2) Within a command prompt, navigate to the diamond folder created in the previous step and run ```diamond makedb --in ../uniref100.fasta.gz --db ../uniref100```. The process can take a while. Note: If using Linux or Mac, replace ```diamond``` with ```./diamond```.

3) Extract the contents of NCBI Taxonomy dump to its own folder within ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_stationary_files```, eg ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_stationary_files/ncbi_taxa```.

4) Within a command prompt, navigate to the ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_stationary_files``` folder and run ```python ExtractUniRefMembers.py```. This will make the file ```uniref100_member_taxa_tbl.csv``` within ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_stationary_files```. Copy this file into the taxa folder from step 3, eg ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_stationary_files/ncbi_taxa```. This step can also take some time.


### Check

In the end, ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_stationary_files``` should have two new files, ```uniref100.dmnd``` and ```uniref100.fasta```. It should also contain two folders, ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_stationary_files/diamond``` and ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_stationary_files/ncbi_taxa```, if using default names. 
The diamond folder should contain the diamond file, while the taxa_folder should contain the contents of the NCBI Taxanomy dump (.dmp files), and the file ```uniref100_member_taxa_tbl.csv```. If the names of these two new folders differ from the default used in the readme, the config.yaml file must be edited to point to these new folders, see the repo config.yaml for an example.


## Usage

Currently, only .mgf files are supported. To use, simply follow these steps.

1) Place the input into a separate folder WITHIN the ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_input_files/``` directory. This folder should have a descriptive name. 

2) Edit the ```config.yaml``` file within the ```Kaiko_volume``` directory to include the location of the folder with the input. An example can be found in the current file ```config.yaml```.

3) Run the command ``` python Kaiko_pipeline_main.py ``` within the main directory of this repo. The ```kaiko_defaults.yaml``` file will fill in any necessary parameters not present in ```config.yaml```


The ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_intermediate/``` folder will be populated with a few intermediate files. These are named using the ```mgf_input``` folder name. The final FASTA output can be found within ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_output/``` folder, again named using the folder name of the input.

4) If you would like to profile the pipeline using cProfile, add the ```profile = True``` flag to the config file. To use memory-profiler, within the main repo directory, run ```mprof run --include-children Kaiko_pipeline_main.py```.

## Usage with Docker

To use the pipeline within Docker, follow steps 1-2 in Usage, then jump here:

3) (Docker) Run the command ```docker build -f Dockerfile_tensorflow2.12.0-py310 -t tensorflow2.12.0-py310 .``` to make the tensorflow image.

4) (Docker) Run the command ```docker build . -t kaiko-py310``` to build the Kaiko docker image using the tensorflow image from step 3)

5) (Docker) Run the command ```docker run --name Kaiko_container-py310 -v path_Kaiko_volume:/Kaiko_pipeline/Kaiko_volume kaiko-py310 python Kaiko_pipeline_main.py```, where path_Kaiko_volume is the absolute path to the Kaiko_volume folder. This allows Docker to store the outputs in Kaiko_volume. For example, such a command may look like ```docker run --name Kaiko_container-py310 -v C:/Users/memmys/Documents/GitHub/Kaiko_pipeline/Kaiko_volume/:/Kaiko_pipeline/Kaiko_volume kaiko-py310 python Kaiko_pipeline_main.py```

6) (Docker) Make sure to update the config file to point to the Linux version of diamond. See the setup for more details.

The ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_intermediate/``` folder will be populated with a few intermediate files. These are named using the ```mgf_input``` folder name. The final FASTA output can be found within ```Kaiko_volume/Kaiko_output/``` folder, again named using the folder name of the input.


## Unit Tests

After installing the files, we should ensure the denovo network is producing the expected output given the model. To do this, navigate to the main repo folder in a command prompt and run ```python kaiko_unit_test.py```. This runs the denovo model on a predetermined dataset and compares line by line to stored output.
